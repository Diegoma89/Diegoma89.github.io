Oriole's tasting menu is stimulating and utterly contemporary; borderless with its interweaving of global flavors. It all begins with a cavalcade of delicate small bites: Aged hamachi with fresh wasabi and truffle honey shows a fascinating sweetness. Maine uni with yuzu kosho and puffed rice has fantastic crunch. A single crab shumai bobs in a soothing kabocha and ginger broth. Caraway cappellini is paired with a rich yeast butter, puffed wheat, and shaved black truffle for a heady dish. Desserts offer a tempting array from a celery-pistachio financier and guava Danish to sweet potato cheesecake and peppermint-dark chocolate bon bon. Oriole thinks of everything; there is even a non-alcoholic beverage pairing on offer.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=41.8861960,-87.6451300&language=en-US",Oriole,2,https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/oriole,183,183,183,1,41.886196,-87.64513,215,215,150,150

The ethos that has made the cooking in Scandinavia so influential—fierce adherence to seasonality and respect for nature’s larder—may not seem particularly groundbreaking but for many a chef and restaurateur it prompted some sort of epiphany. The good news is that, thanks to the great Dane Claus Meyer, you don’t need to fly there to find out more. Agern is hidden at the Vanderbilt Hall end of Grand Central Terminal but has been designed with such understated elegance that you quickly forget where you are. The restaurant also leads into the Nordic-themed “Great Northern Food Hall” so go ahead and embrace the hygge. Ingredients like havgus, söl, and ymer may not exactly roll off the tongue but Icelandic chef Gunnar Gíslason uses them, along with pickling, smoking, and fermenting, to deliver sharper, more defined, and more natural flavors.

The impressive 15-piece version can be tailored somewhat as diners can opt for sushi only or sushi with sashimi, as well as such luxe supplemental items as uni, toro, king crab and ankimo (monkfish liver). Here, fish is minimally embellished, relying instead on original sourcing and the chef’s impeccable technique.

The wood paneling and beer-hall tables tell of family gatherings, friends united, deal making, success celebrated and stories swapped. It’s evocative and unforgettable. It’s also unapologetically old-school—computerization and credit cards remain fanciful futuristic concepts, so you’ll need to come with a few Benjamins tucked into your wallet. Start with a thick slice of bacon to get your taste buds up to speed before the steak arrives. These slabs of finely marbled Porterhouse are dry-aged in-house for around 28 days, which means there’s tenderloin on one side of the bone and strip steak on the other. They are then broiled to perfection, sliced before being brought to the table, and served with their own sauce as well as a host of sides, which range from their version of German fried potatoes to creamed spinach. If you can still feel a pulse, go ahead and order dessert, if only to get a mound of their famous schlag made in the back.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=40.7098600,-73.9626300&language=en-US",Peter Luger,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/brooklyn/restaurant/peter-luger,113,113,113,1,40.70986,-73.96263,150,150,75,75

Begin with a ceviche of fairly firm and meaty jackfish enhanced by yuzu and glistening with finger lime, or use your hands to pick up a delicate mound of plump sea urchin on crunchy toast—a house signature. Then, translucent, moist and bite-sized king salmon matched with smooth celeriac purée will leave you yearning for more—quite like the enticingly sauced filet of meltingly tender venison, and in true California style, charred avocado.

Those terrace tables have some of the best views around. Meals may be inspired by the comforting flavors of Sacramento Delta asparagus soup bobbing with lobster bits lurking at the bowl's base. Then Kurobuta pork chop set atop a red wine-Meyer lemon sauce is cooked to a perfect blush and served alongside intensely charred rapini for refreshing bitterness. A warm pineapple tart surrounded by a swirl of salted caramel makes for a sweet, savory and deliciously fruity bite.

There is a clear element of luxury coursing through the veins of this hideaway. The chef's omakase is considerably impressive, exuding personality and confidence by virtue of product that is expertly aged and handled. Diners are in for a treat as this master seasons rice, deftly slices fish and sears fatty tuna collar under the blazing-hot binchotan.

Stylish servers—who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair—remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella.

Those, however, who think Austrian food is all Wiener schnitzel and apple strudel should think again, because this cuisine is itself made up of a host of influences, stretching from Italy all the way to the Balkans. Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner and his kitchen also demonstrate how cuisines can evolve to respect contemporary tastes without compromising their integrity. So while there are plenty of classics on offer at all times, including quark spaetzle with succulent, tender rabbit, there are also lighter dishes like cod with squash and chanterelles.

While the décor feels minimalist, surrounded by an industrial edge of soaring concrete ceilings and exposed pipes, service is wonderfully engaging and attentive, with thorough explanations of each unique course. À la carte is offered, but the multi-course kappo-style is the best way to experience this kitchen's creations. Dishes bring together a unique range of inspired Japanese flavors, but equal attention is given to texture and artistic presentations. Fixed menus here present a progression of courses selected by the chefs, which may include a few raw dishes. Highlights reveal an innovative ""true chicken teriyaki"" that has been dried and rehydrated to render enticingly chewy results. A bowl of California rice with favas, peas and shiso makes for a delicious prelude to Holstein steak topped with spicy wasabi and diced pickled plum that's been aged for four years.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=34.0441550,-118.2561340&language=en-US",Shibumi,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/shibumi559644,113,113,113,1,34.044155,-118.256134,150,150,75,75

The lab-like décor isn't a coincidence, since the modern cooking on display here is highly experimental (though deftly avoids mad scientist status).

There are those famous liquid olives, of course, as well as meaty morels served with ""peas"" that are actually ""pearls"" filled with fragrant pea and mint. Playful course after course reminds one that a snail is not just a snail here, but a dome of Ibérico ham gel, formed like that mollusk, served with rabbit jus and escargot roe.

That signature slow-poached egg yolk sitting in a bed of onion- and malt-infused cream is a consistent and thrilling revelation; while white sturgeon caviar with creamed potato and beer-marinated onion resembles an exquisitely elevated sour cream-and-onion dip. Perfectly cooked mussels set over porridge-like grains is yet another beautiful plate that reflects this kitchen's keen attention to detail.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=37.8247600,-122.2550500&language=en-US",Commis,2,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/oakland/restaurant/commis,113,113,113,1,37.82476,-122.25505,150,150,75,75

Hunting and foraging are star features of this local, seasonal menu, and though her multi-course menu changes nightly (sometimes leading to subtle variations in quality) she consistently utilizes ingredients in ways that push the envelope. As proof of her talent, her popular cooking classes regularly sell out, even at $1,000 a pop. Tucked into a bright interior, festooned with dried branches, river rocks, antlers and pottery, the décor alters with the menu. But the highlight of the space remains its fully open kitchen. Likewise, service is cheerful, warm and attentive, if a touch casual at times. Dinner is likely to be an earthy ten—albeit manageable—course affair, and might begin with a creamy scoop of wildly fresh cheese set over sorel mushroom purée and topped with a cloud of elderflower foam, spruce shoots and foraged plant bulbs. Later, a bread service featuring soft goat butter, crisp pork cracklings and luscious whipped lardo is memorable to say the least. At the end, a knob of turbot reaches striking new heights dressed with beurre monté and crunchy white asparagus.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=41.9695550,-87.6887360&language=en-US",Elizabeth,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/elizabeth,113,113,113,1,41.969555,-87.688736,150,150,75,75

Inside this much-celebrated space, arched ceilings stretch overhead, while a roaring fireplace sends light dancing off the marble. Glossy windows overlook the golf course greens, and guests settle in for one of San Diego's most coveted meals. Critically acclaimed Chef William Bradley spins out one long dinner every evening, which is brought to you at the hands of gracious, polished and effortless servers. His French-influenced compositions are downright gorgeous, brightened up with a touch of southern California sparkle—and every resulting morsel is nothing short of revelatory. Guests can choose from a four-course menu (with multiple options available in each section); or a far more involved tasting that's left entirely to the chef's discretion. The latter is the favorite by far and may highlight an heirloom pumpkin velouté with crispy shallots and toasted rye crumbs; while a plump, perfectly cooked Hokkaido scallop arrives with silky cauliflower purée, osetra caviar and savory brown butter foam.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=32.9399030,-117.2001300&language=en-US",Addison,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-san-diego/restaurant/addison,113,113,113,1,32.939903,-117.20013,150,150,75,75

Aside from its Instagram-ready good looks, it's a dining destination thanks to Chef Matthew Kammerer’s distinctive cuisine. Great care is paid to details here, from employing local woods to smoke and grill as well as fish caught right off the coast, to house-made sea salt and vinegars. Savor the fresh tuna, aged for eight days and brushed with salted plum paste, jalapeño and okra for a riot of flavors.

Each of the three tasting menus features the freshest and most sustainable seafood, often wild-caught from American waters. Chef Michael Cimarusti uses these ingredients deftly to craft his California cuisine inspired by the flavors and ideas of Asia and the Mediterranean. The sheer range of styles proves this kitchen’s talent and technical know-how, using classic methods to pair seafood with rich sauces. The uni egg served in its shell with warm yolk and champagne beurre-blanc is—unsurprisingly—a luxurious signature. Meals here usually begin on a high note with a diverse selection of canapés, including the nasturtium leaf taco filled with sushi rice, arare crackers and sea beans; or pickled sardine crostini topped with coriander blossom.

The protein-centric menu reads like an ode to California’s purveyors, and a focus on seasonality is in keeping with the area’s ethos. Unsurprisingly, the results are often rewarding: succulent, perfectly balanced heirloom tomatoes are twirled with crunchy seaweed, briny clams and mirin dressing, while flaky halibut arrives atop a richly flavored fennel-tomato beurre blanc, dotted with corn and huitlacoche pudding. The signature “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit” showcases the kitchen’s creativity, bringing together a confit rabbit leg, an applewood-smoked bacon-wrapped loin and a minuscule rack of chops rounded out with Yukon Gold potatoes and a whole grain mustard-cream sauce.

They never dial down the intensity—one bite of the fluke buried under fresh passionfruit granita and curry powder and you'll soon be hip to their style. Each dish delivers a remarkable mouthful, and most of the kitchen's creations are rich, as well as unexpected. Foie gras served with warm banana bread and cocoa nibs is decadently delicious; seared scallop and roe served with yuzu curd and a palate-cleansing citrus salad is bright and clever; and monkfish set in a Benton's bacon broth hits the mark with balanced flavors. It's a steady stream of hits all the way to dessert. Thai iced tea, served as a panna cotta with coconut pop rocks, fingerlime sorbet, and meringue, shows off their flair for whimsy, but that mango panna cotta with Thai-basil granita and charred Japanese sushi rice is a complete and utter showstopper.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=41.8952479,-87.6386755&language=en-US",Entente,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/entente,95,95,95,1,41.8952479,-87.6386755,130,130,60,60

The kitchen is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but rest assured that its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are far more sophisticated than they pretend to be. Creamy scrambled eggs with uni is a must; caramelized scallops come with a well-balanced green curry; confit goat will make you question why you don’t see more of it on other menus; and the spiced lamb sausages really pack a flavor punch.

Though tables are mini, the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision—a window into where the magic happens offers views of a slow-rotating rotisserie and crackling embers. Danzer and Redding’s offerings are certainly rooted in this nation’s cuisine, but they give each dish a unique spin thereby infusing vibrant flavor into small plates, large plates, “charcoal-grilled goodies,” desserts and drinking snacks. Laab neuh gae is a spicy chopped lamb salad with a wonderfully sour dressing; and Thai-style blood sausage cooked in banana leaf has an intriguing flavor.

Descriptions are concise but there’s more complexity to the understated modern dishes than first appears.

The room itself might be relaxed and homely but the cooking is contrastingly modern.

Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile floors complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, the ambience is decidedly inviting and Chef Andrew Zimmerman’s cuisine is firmly grounded in the present. Settle into one of their spacious tables and look forward to a meal that reflects the delicious amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean and Mediterranean tastes. But, it is at dinner when this kitchen truly shines. Gnocchi for instance may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich flavors of lamb sugo and ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken is downright exciting, served crisp-skinned with a buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel and sausage. Simple-sounding desserts keep the bar high until the very end of the feast, and may include a toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=41.8839400,-87.6424700&language=en-US",Sepia,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/sepia,63,63,63,1,41.88394,-87.64247,75,75,50,50

Yes, its façade may appear rather sterile, but one foot inside this expansive room and you will be enveloped in warmth and cordiality. The gentle strains of soothing tunes, bright red and gold accents, as well as ample, well-accoutered tables segue smoothly into a classic and regal Chinese repast. Proficient and accommodating, the staff is happy to steer diners through the menu—a veritable tome—and wine list. Dishes are then turned out in a judicious manner, unveiling such stellar presentations as sweet and tender shell-on shrimp seasoned with dried red chilies along with more inventive combinations like braised sea cucumber with beef tendon and scallions. Neatly trimmed and gently seared New Zealand lamb chops arrive with lightly fried onions for a divine coupling, and may warrant an order of the perfectly fluffy shrimp fried rice with egg and bonito.

A commitment to agriculture is clear in everything: seed packets arrive with the check and each bottle of wine has a one-dollar surcharge that is donated to charities like the Lincoln Park Conservancy or Chicago Rarities Orchard Project. Chef Bruce Sherman's particular style seems to fly in the face of those minimalist competitors who use menus to list single ingredients. Here, dishes are described comprehensively as a flurry of components that may not always seem to fit together with great success. Try neatly trimmed Arctic char that is slow-roasted for silken texture, then served with embellishments like house-made sauerkraut, mustard seeds, candied walnuts and dauphine potatoes.

Located in a repurposed brick building across from the Metra tracks, the look is unapologetically industrial with an expansive layout that unwinds into a series of seating options, inviting bar, and an open kitchen with another small bar set against pretty blue tiles. Curved, high-backed booths lend intimacy to counter the room’s sheer size. Stainless steel tanks displayed in the back hold the culinary-minded handiwork of their head brewer. On tap, expect a handful of rotating beers. The kitchen’s boundless small and large plates defy expectations with delicious success. Scallop ceviche straddles the line between sweet and sour courtesy of chartreuse, candied ginger, and roast shishito peppers. Who knew a single carrot could have such power? Salt-cured, roasted, and glazed in miso caramel, then set upon beluga lentils and creamy coconut milk—it's a revelation.

The classic former warehouse—complete with the requisite exposed ducts, concrete floors and brick walls—has been glammed up with a stainless steel exhibition kitchen, chrome and leather furnishings, pendant lights suspended from nautical rope and an impressive glass-encased wine cellar. It’s all very relaxed, albeit in a well-dressed way, and the feel-good vibe extends to the staff, who clearly like working here as much as diners enjoy lingering over the multicourse meals. Chef/owner Nicholas Stefanelli's Puglian heritage comes through in the menu, which features four or five courses, along with a nightly tasting. The kitchen hits all the right notes balancing trendy and serious. Begin with a cigar box filled with focaccia so sinfully delicious, you’ll be tempted to scarf it all down—but don’t. You’ll want to save room for the spicy fish stew, a thing of beauty practically brimming with tripe and lobster, or house-made maccheroni with a thick and gamey goat ragù.

There’s even a small bar, which means you don’t have to time your arrival to the dot but can gather first for a cocktail. Chef Shigeyuki Tsunoda undertakes his duties with calm, unhurried efficiency and his omakase—in contrast to the surroundings—is rooted in tradition. Before the Edomae-style nigiri come various snacks that are especially enjoyable when paired with something from their broad range of nihonshu. A seasonal soup and creamy chawanmushi with generous spoonfuls of both Hokkaido uni and Osetra caviar are followed by tender abalone, rich red bonito, succulent scallop, and other mouthfuls of delight. The nigiri is an easy-to-eat size and the rice is body temperature so its flavor really comes through.

Prime Scottish produce – particularly vegetables – are the chef’s passion.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=55.9769670,-3.1728420&language=en-US",Kitchin,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/city-of-edinburgh/leith/restaurant/kitchin,58,72,72,1.24,55.976967,-3.172842,80,99,35,43

"" Its youthful ambience and carriage house setting, which dates back to the Civil War, makes a nice contrast. Inside, it's charming and modern, featuring an atrium-like glass ceiling, pale yellow-painted walls, as well as a bright and expansive patio. By day, this is a sweet and sunny café; come nighttime, the wine begins to flow and the tiny tables overflow with dishes laid out like a hazy culinary dream. Chef Aaron Silverman’s cooking style turns classics on their head in the most inventive ways. To wit, his clever and delicious Angel Eggs highlights deviled egg dupes that employ savory meringue as faux egg whites and are piped with egg yolk comprised of mayonnaise and flakes of sea salt. Fancy tater tots then arrive as perfectly fried squares of golden potatoes, topped with a dot of cod roe hollandaise and chives; while marinated and grilled pineapple sambal-chicken wings delight both sweet and savory fiends. The tasting menu is a steal at $45 for eight courses; and the playfully eclectic wine list makes for a great read and is absolutely worth adding on a pairing.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=38.8833557,-76.9936368&language=en-US",Little Pearl,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/washington/washington-dc/restaurant/little-pearl,,45,,1,38.8833557,-76.9936368,,,45,45

Of course, the chefs tasked with taming it—and practically cooking in it—are nothing short of culinary zealots. The heat is brutal and cooking method raw and elemental, but the results are pure bliss. Rolled and fresh-baked pita arrives first and is accompanied by condiments like spicy harissa and garlicky tuom. While this can make for a feast on its own, be patient, as they take on a whole new life when wrapped inside the likes of smoked duck breast or roast chicken. Carnivores can't seem to get enough of the hulking lamb shoulder—dark and charred as volcanic rock but so deliciously tender that it can almost be spread like butter. Piled into the fluffy pita with mint and onions, it's a triumph.

But whereas the London elder is one huge room, this handsome retreat comes divided into three manageable sections, all attended to by a cadre of affable and attentive service staff. There’s a subtle and contemporary British accent to the menu too. Their version of fish and chips takes the national dish to a whole new level, with sweet English peas and triple-cooked chips, while a chutney made from plum and shallots is served with tender roasted Long Island duck and woodsy chanterelles. However, there are other European influences at play, so you may start with a decadent crab and uni risotto, or perfectly done quail and pigeon pie. Make sure to end this feast by sharing a plump, bronzed apple tarte Tatin for two coupled with vanilla ice cream.","https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyDvEyVCVpGtn81z5NrMKgdehPsrO9sJiMw&q=40.7413666,-73.9875324&language=en-US",The Clocktower,1,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/the-clocktower,63,63,63,1,40.7413666,-73.9875324,75,75,50,50

It’s there that the kitchen shines its brightest though, with such elaborate entrées as ricotta gnudi neatly arranged with chanterelles à la Greque, tender squash and golden raisins. The popular key lime tart is an equally impressive display—its crisp and perfect shell topped with toasted marshmallows, viola petals and meringue batons.

This menu is unapologetically French, though Rose infuses his classics with a strong dose of personality, making powerful traditional dishes that may have fallen by the wayside relevant again. For instance, a selection of “gourmandises” (or more indulgent delicacies) showcases such exemplary classics as pike quenelles or sautéed sweetbreads. The latter achieves prominent flavor when paired with tomato crème, and may be tailed by beef cheek and foie gras terrine in a pitch-perfect sherry vinaigrette.
